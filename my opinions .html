<h1> My opinions </h1> 
 
<p> the best cuisine of food to come out of the uk is the Sunday Roast it has a diverse plate of protein carbs and veg with a succulent sauce called gravy that can go on any of the food on the plate, and then the best part is the yorkshire pudding its fluffy, crunchy, tasty and life changing expeirence </p>

</body> some of the sauces you should use, gravy is the best sauce of all time and it compliments the sunday roast, curry sauce should only be used if you have no gravy and will never be as nice, ketchup can only be used with certain parts of the roast.
the most unacceptable thing to use at an sunday roast is having any meat apart from beef, pork and chicken
